            <p>Sliabh Liag Cliffs, situated on the south west coast of County Donegal, are said to be the one of the highest and finest marine cliffs in Europe. To fully enjoy the spectacle of Sliabh Liag it is best to leave your car at the car park and walk the few miles to the cliffs so as not to miss the exciting scenery of the area.  There are terrific views of the Atlantic Ocean, the Sligo Mountains and Donegal Bay as you walk towards the terrifyingly high top of Sliabh Liag, where the cliff face of Bunglas rises over 600m above the raging ocean. Experienced walkers only should venture beyond the viewing point onto One Man's Pass which loops around onto the Pilgrim's Path. This is a sacred mountain, for over a thousand years there was a Christian pilgrimage, no doubt Sliabh Liag was a sacred mountain before the Christians arrived here. You should remember this when visiting, so please do not disturb these monuments of Irish cultural heritage. There's much to know about Sliabh Liag, like the monks who went to Iceland or the eagle and the baby. To learn more visit the award winning Slieve Liag Cliffs Centre which is all about local culture, food and crafts served with a real warm Donegal welcome and sense of humour.
            The Slieve League (Grey Mountain) cliffs, situated on the West coast of Donegal, are said to be the highest and one of the finest marine cliffs in Europe with a three hundred metre drop straight down into the wild, Atlantic waves below. This creates a breathtaking but extremely scary view. Click <a href="https://www.discoverireland.ie/Arts-Culture-Heritage/sliabh-liag-slieve-league-cliffs/10845">here</a> to find information link.  
            However, there is much more to see besides the cliffs. One is advised to leave one's car and walk the 2-3 km to the cliffs so as not to miss the exciting scenery of the area. There are terrific views of the sea and the Sligo Mountains to be seen. Donegal Bay can be clearly seen as you walk towards the terrifyingly high top of Slieve League and there is a small lake at eye level. A short walk will take you to the right of the amazing cliff face of Bunglas (which literally means end of the cliff) which rises over 306m above the raging ocean. One Man's Path will take you to the summit of Slieve League but the climb must be approached with extreme caution as it is very dangerous.  The ruins of a church with some early Christian hermitages lie near the pass. Returning from the summit by foot, one will pass the ruin of a watchtower at the end of Carrigan Head. This watchtower was constructed to defend the north-west coast during the early 19th century when there was the threat of Napoleonic attack. Walking on the eastern side of Slieve League there is a magnificent wilderness of rocks, streams and a deep rugged valley to your left.  At the end of the walk you will be left feeling refreshed and relaxed and glad you didn't miss the 
            awesome cliffs of Slieve League. Click <a href="https://www.discoveringireland.com/vacations/slieve-league/">here</a> to find information link.</p>

        <h2><u>Glenveagh National Park</u></h2>

        <p>Glenveagh National Park is the second largest national park in Ireland.  In Winter 2018, the wind breaking and historical Rhododendron wall that led up to the castle, and that was organized by Mrs Adair, was entirely removed by Glenveagh National Park. When questioned about its removal, the administration noted that rhododendron was an invasive species.  Planning permission was requested to clear all non-native trees and plants along the river, going from the Lake to Old Bridge House. Winter 2018 saw a large clearing of Pines around the castle.  New water pipes and system laid out around the park grounds, with daily construction activity.The estate was established by John Adair, who became infamous for evicting 244 of his tenants and clearing the land so they would not spoil his view of the landscape. The gardens and castle were presented to the Irish nation in 1981 by Henry P. McIlhenny of Philadelphia who had purchased the estate in 1937.  The castle was built by Captain John George Adair (1823-1885), a native of County Laois, and a member of the minor gentry. Adair had made his fortune in the United States, and he returned to Ireland and bought up vast tracts of land in Donegal. Adair had married in 1869, Cornelia Wadsworth Ritchie, a daughter of James S. Wadsworth, a Union General in the American Civil War. Together they set about the creation of the gardens and castle. Adair's ambition was to create an estate and castle that surpassed Balmoral, Queen Victoria's Scottish retreat.  His troubles with Irish tenants on his land began immediately. A row between them and Adair over shooting rights and trespassing sheep culminated in the murder of Adair's Scottish steward James Murrog. Consequently, John Adair evicted 44 families (224 people total) from their blackhouses on his land. His widow Cornelia Adair (1837–1921) took over ownership of the castle and estate after John Adair's death in 1885. She lived part-time at Glenveagh Castle, and improved the beauty of the castle grounds. She brought much biodiversity with both practical and exotic ambitions. Practical being Fast Growing and long living Pines that would offer wind shelter to the castle and gardens. The pines along the river and lake also helped prevent the flooding of the grounds and along the banks. The pleasure grounds were created as a garden oasis that would showcase exotic and native plants, trees, and flowers from around the world. The Rhododendron was brought in as an ornamental as well as practical solution for wind breaking and protection. Mrs Adair's long Rhododendron hedge had grown into a tall wall that followed the drive up to the castle. This was a wonderful wind shelter and introduction to coming up to the castle. December 2018, this historical hedge was destroyed entirely to put in a new water pipe.Henry Plumer McIlhenny of Philadelphia, USA purchased the estate in 1937. McIlhenny left the gardens and  castle to the Irish nation in the 1970s, but continued to use the castle as a part-time residence until 1982.

        <h2><u>Donegal Town</u></h2>

        <p>Donegal Castle (Irish: Caisleán Dhún na nGall) is a castle situated in the centre of Donegal Town in County Donegal in Ulster, Ireland. For most of the last two centuries, the majority of the buildings lay in ruins but the castle was almost fully restored in the early 1990s.  The castle consists of a 15th-century rectangular keep with a later Jacobean style wing. The complex is sited on a bend in the River Eske, near the mouth of Donegal Bay, and is surrounded by a 17th-century boundary wall. There is a small gatehouse at its entrance mirroring the design of the keep. Most of the stonework was constructed from locally sourced limestone with some sandstone. The castle was the stronghold of the O'Donnell clan, Lords of Tír Conaill and one of the most powerful Gaelic families in Ireland from the 5th to the 16th centuries.Donegal (Irish: Dún na nGall), translates as Fort of the Foreigner possibly coming from a Viking fortress in the area destroyed in 1159. However, due to hundreds of years of development, no archaeological evidence of this early fortress has been found. Red Hugh O’Donnell (Red Hugh I), wealthy chief of the O’Donnell clan, built the castle in 1474. At the same time, he and his wife Nuala built a Franciscan monastery further down the river. A local legend[citation needed] tells of a tunnel connecting the two but no evidence for this has been found. The castle was regarded as one of the finest Gaelic castles in Ireland. In 1607, after the Nine Years war the leaders of the O'Donnell clan left Ireland in the Flight of the Earls. In 1611, during the Plantation of Ulster, the castle and its lands were granted to an English Captain, Basil Brooke. The towerhouse was severely damaged by the departing O'Donnells to prevent the castle being used against the Gaelic clans but was quickly restored by its new owners. Brooke also added windows, a gable and a large manor-house wing to the keep, all in the Jacobean style.  The Brooke family owned the castle up until the 1670s, when they moved to near Lisnaskea in County Fermanagh. At that time, in the 1670s, the Brookes sold the castle to the Gore dynasty, who later became Earls of Arran in the Peerage of Ireland. The castle fell into a ruinous state under the Gores in the early 18th century. In 1898, the then owner, The 5th Earl of Arran, vested the castle in the care of The Office of Public Works.
